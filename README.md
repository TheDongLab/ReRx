# ReRx_drug_repurposing_multicohort

This code repository provides scripts on the systematic analysis of the study entitled **"Drug Repurposing for Parkinson’s Disease: A Large-Scale Multi-Cohort Study"**, which aims to identify drugs associated with the risk and progression of PD to provide insights into potential therapeutics and targets.

We leveraged data from the Mass General Brigham (MGB) Biobank for discovery and the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Parkinson’s Disease (AMP-PD) program for replication. Specifically, two largest AMP-PD sub-cohorts (PPMI and PDBP) were integrated to forge the replication cohort.

## 🔬 Analysis Process
### 1. Data Cleaning of Medication Records
The Medication.R and Drug_dictionary.R scripts are used to clean and standardize medication records from all three cohorts.

Scripts
- **`Medication.R`**:
Prepares cleaned medication datasets for downstream modeling.

- **`Drug_dictionary.R`**:
Maps medication records to generic drug names using PubChem API and DrugBank.

### 2. Drug-PD Association Analysis
Includes propensity score matching, logistic regression, replication, and sensitivity analyses.

Scripts
- **`PD_risk.R`**:
Main analysis: PSM, plots, logistic regression.

- **`Replication.R`**:
Identifies replicated drugs (by name and by ATC codes).

- **`Sensitivity_analysis.R`**:
Dose effect and reverse causality sensitivity analyses.

- **`Characteristic.R`**:
Calculates demographic characteristics.

- **`PD_progression.R`**:
Linear mixed-effects model for cognitive and motor progression.

### 3. Drug-Target Gene Expression Analysis
The **`Target_genes.R`** script maps drug target genes to cell types to explore therapeutic potential.
